# DECISIONS.md — Autonomous build log

Every non-trivial decision made while executing `RERUN_BUILD_DIRECTIVE.md` is logged
here, in chronological order, with what was chosen, what was rejected, and why. This is
the audit trail for the human to review the agent's judgment after the fact.

---

## 2026-09-19 — Repo bootstrap

**Decision:** Initialized a plain `git init` repo at `B:\Desktop\RERUN_Nvidia` (no
existing VCS state found — the directory only contained `RERUN_BUILD_DIRECTIVE.md`).
Created the full directory skeleton from §4.2 of the directive up front, before writing
any implementation code, so every file has an obvious home as it's built.

**Rejected:** Waiting to create structure lazily, file-by-file. Rejected because the
directive's architecture (§4) and repo layout (§4.2) are already fully specified —
there's no discovery step needed, so building the skeleton first avoids later
reshuffling.

---

## 2026-09-19 — Local toolchain

**Observed:** Local machine has Python 3.14.4, Node v24.15.0, npm 11.12.1. The
directive pins **Python 3.11** for the backend (§4.1). Decision: target Python 3.11 in
`pyproject.toml` (`requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.13"`) and in the sandbox execution
image, since 3.11 is the stack the directive fixes and what target paper repos will
most reliably support — but development/test execution on this machine will run under
whatever interpreter is actually installed (3.14) unless a 3.11 interpreter or venv is
provisioned. This does not violate rule §2.7 (fixed stack) since the *target* runtime
for FastAPI/sandbox stays 3.11-declared; it only affects which interpreter runs pytest
locally during this build. Flagged: if any 3.11-only syntax/behavior assumption turns
up, a local 3.11 venv should be installed via `pyenv`/`uv` before Phase 0's live gate.

## 2026-09-19 — Order of implementation within Phase 0/1/2

**Decision:** Within a single build pass, implement and test the **pure, deterministic,
no-network, no-credential** modules first — `classifier.py` (§5.2), `tamper_gate.py`
(§5.3), and `passport.py` (§6.3) — ahead of `sandbox.py`'s live Nebius Token Factory
integration, even though Phase 0 is nominally "first" in §11's table.

**Why:** Phase 0's actual gate (`pytest tests/test_sandbox_smoke.py` green with 3 real
sandboxes created and destroyed) requires a live Nebius Token Factory API credential
that is not present in this environment yet (no `.env`, no key supplied). Rule §2.4
("never invent a method signature and hope") and the anti-fake-result rule in §0 both
forbid writing a sandbox test that claims to pass without hitting the real API. Writing
the deterministic modules first produces real, independently-runnable green tests
*today* (`pytest tests/test_classifier.py`, `pytest tests/test_tamper_gate.py`,
`pytest tests/test_passport.py`) while the sandbox client code is written to the real
Nebius API shape (verified via docs, not guessed) and left ready to run the moment a
`NEBIUS_API_KEY` is supplied in `.env`.

**Blocker surfaced to human (not a stop, just a note):** Phase 0's live gate cannot be
marked green until `NEBIUS_API_KEY` (and any Token Factory sandbox/project id) is
provided. This is tracked, not blocking forward progress on Phases 1–2's deterministic
cores, batch corpus research, and frontend scaffolding.

## 2026-09-19 — classifier.py implemented and green (Phase 1 core)

**Decision:** Implemented `backend/app/services/classifier.py` as pure regex/rule
matching over `(exit_code, stderr, stdout, declared_deps)` — no network, no model call,
per §2.1. All 12 taxonomy codes from §5.2 are represented; `ENTRYPOINT_UNCLEAR` is kept
as a shared constant only (never emitted by `classify()`) since that verdict is decided
pre-execution by recon, per §6.1 — a dedicated test
(`test_entrypoint_unclear_is_not_reachable_from_classify`) locks this in so a future
edit can't accidentally wire a post-execution regex to it.

**Result:** `pytest tests/test_classifier.py -v` — 26/26 passed. Every taxonomy code has
≥1 positive test and ≥1 negative-control test, satisfying the Phase 1 gate in §11.

**Rejected alternative:** Classifying by parsing tracebacks structurally (e.g. via
`traceback`/`tokenize`) instead of regex. Rejected because target repos' failures come
back as opaque captured stderr text from a sandboxed subprocess, not a live exception
object — regex over text is the actual available signal, and it is fully deterministic
and auditable, which is what §2.1 requires.

## 2026-09-19 — tamper_gate.py implemented and green (Phase 2 core, the differentiator)

**Decision:** Implemented `backend/app/services/tamper_gate.py` using `unidiff` for
diff parsing and stdlib `ast` (not `libcst`) for structural analysis, per the explicit
"unidiff + libcst (or ast)" alternative in §4.1's stack table — chosen because the gate
only ever needs read-only structural analysis (does this call still get reached, is
this except-handler new and broad), never lossless source rewriting, so the heavier
`libcst` CST dependency buys nothing here. `libcst` was therefore dropped from
`backend/pyproject.toml`.

**All six §5.3 rejection rules implemented:** `DELETED_EVAL_CALL`,
`STUBBED_MODEL_CALL`, `REDUCED_SCALE`, `BROAD_EXCEPTION_SWALLOW`,
`PROTECTED_PATH_MODIFIED`, `DIFF_TOO_LARGE`. One defensive rule was added beyond the
six: `UNPARSEABLE_PATCH` — if a patch doesn't even parse as valid Python after
reconstruction, the gate rejects rather than silently skipping its other checks on that
file, since a deterministic gate must never PASS something it cannot actually verify.

**Reachability analysis (closes a §14 red-team gap up front):** rules 1 and 2 don't just
count textual occurrences of a matched call — they compare the set of calls *reachable*
from module-level execution (a best-effort, single-file call graph: module-level
statements → transitively into any locally-defined function they call) before and after
the patch. This specifically catches the exact failure mode §14 calls out: "wrapping
the eval call in a function that's never called" would leave a naive text/AST-count
check unchanged, but drops the call out of the reachable set, and the gate correctly
rejects it (see
`test_deleted_eval_call_wrapped_in_never_called_function_is_rejected`). Documented
limitation: this call graph does not follow imports or track dynamic dispatch
(`getattr(obj, name)()`, decorators that rebind a function, etc.) — it is best-effort
within a single file, not a soundness guarantee.

**REDUCED_SCALE heuristic:** implemented as regex pairing of removed/added lines
matching `<scale-keyword> = <int>` (epochs, samples, dataset_size, etc.) within the same
diff hunk. The "unless already parameterized via CLI" exception (§5.3) is checked by
searching the *original* file for an `argparse.add_argument('--<key>', ...)` call
naming the same key. This is intentionally a bounded heuristic, not a general dataflow
analysis — logged here rather than silently shipped as if it were exhaustive.

**Result:** `pytest tests/test_tamper_gate.py -v` — 22/22 passed, including the exact
Phase 2 gate requirement from §11: "a hand-crafted 'delete the eval call' patch is
asserted REJECTED" (`test_deleted_eval_call_direct_removal_is_rejected`), a passing
negative control for every one of the six (now seven, with the defensive addition)
rules, and two integration tests (`test_legitimate_minimal_fix_passes_with_no_violations`
proves the gate doesn't over-reject; `test_multi_violation_patch_records_every_rule_hit`
proves multiple violations on one patch are all surfaced, not just the first).

**Bugs caught by the tests themselves, fixed before commit:** (1) the broad-exception
new-code-span check initially crashed on `ast.walk()` nodes lacking a `lineno` attribute
(e.g. `ast.Load`) — fixed by only considering nodes that actually have one; (2) the
Mock-injection detector originally required the mocked name to appear *after*
`Mock(`/`MagicMock(` in the same line, which missed the common `name = MagicMock(...)`
assignment form — fixed to a per-line co-occurrence check instead of an ordered regex.
